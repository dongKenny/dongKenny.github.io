          <p>
            I'm an ambitious software engineer with experience in designing, documenting, creating, deploying, and delivering large-scale products to customers at Amazon.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm strong with independent growth and research but also know when to rely on others and ask questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a lifelong learner, I'm constantly trying to improve at Japanese, guitar, baking, and design principles!
